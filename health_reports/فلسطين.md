## Delegation Scan

**Errors**:

No errors to display.

**Warnings**:

No warnings to display.

**Notices**:

* Additional name server listed at child: ns1.gov.ps A name server listed at the child, but not at the parent, was found. This is most likely a configuration error, but there are sometimes reasons for setting up a zone this way.
* Additional name server listed at child: ote.pnina.ps A name server listed at the child, but not at the parent, was found. This is most likely a configuration error, but there are sometimes reasons for setting up a zone this way.
* No IPv6 name servers found.

**Statuses**:

No statuses to display.

## Nameserver Scan

### `dns1.gov.ps`

**Errors**:

No errors to display.

**Warnings**:

No warnings to display.

**Notices**:

No notices to display.

**Statuses**:

No statuses to display.

### `dns3.gov.ps`

**Errors**:

No errors to display.

**Warnings**:

* Name server dns3.gov.ps (212.14.253.242) is recursive. The name server answers recursive queries for 3rd parties (such as DNSCheck). By making a recursive query to a name server that provides recursion, an attacker can cause a name server to look up and cache information contained in zones under their control. Thus the victim name server is made to query the attacker's malicious name servers, resulting in the victim caching and serving bogus data.

**Notices**:

No notices to display.

**Statuses**:

No statuses to display.

### `idn.pnina.ps`

**Errors**:

* Name server idn.pnina.ps (208.64.68.164) does not answer queries over UDP. The name server failed to answer queries sent over UDP.  This is probably due to the name server not correctly set up or due to misconfigured filtering in a firewall.
* Name server idn.pnina.ps (208.64.68.164) does not answer queries over TCP. The name server failed to answer queries sent over TCP.  This is probably due to the name server not correctly set up or due to misconfgured filtering in a firewall. It is a rather common misconception that DNS does not need TCP unless they provide zone transfers - perhaps the name server administrator is not aware that TCP usually is a requirement.

**Warnings**:

* Could not find reverse address for 208.64.68.164 (164.68.64.208.in-addr.arpa.). PTR record(s) for the address could not be found in the .arpa-zone. (ip6.arpa. for IPv6 addresses and in-addr.arpa. for IPv4).

**Notices**:

No notices to display.

**Statuses**:
