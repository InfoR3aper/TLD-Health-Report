## Delegation Scan

**Errors**:

No errors to display.

**Warnings**:

No warnings to display.

**Notices**:

* Additional name server listed at child: ns-b.nic.lk A name server listed at the child, but not at the parent, was found. This is most likely a configuration error, but there are sometimes reasons for setting up a zone this way.

**Statuses**:

No statuses to display.

### `ns-b.nic.lk`

**Errors**:

* Name server ns-b.nic.lk (123.231.18.49) does not answer queries over UDP. The name server failed to answer queries sent over UDP.  This is probably due to the name server not correctly set up or due to misconfigured filtering in a firewall.
* Name server ns-b.nic.lk (123.231.18.49) does not answer queries over TCP. The name server failed to answer queries sent over TCP.  This is probably due to the name server not correctly set up or due to misconfgured filtering in a firewall. It is a rather common misconception that DNS does not need TCP unless they provide zone transfers - perhaps the name server administrator is not aware that TCP usually is a requirement.

**Warnings**:

* Could not find reverse address for 123.231.18.49 (49.18.231.123.in-addr.arpa.). PTR record(s) for the address could not be found in the .arpa-zone. (ip6.arpa. for IPv6 addresses and in-addr.arpa. for IPv4).
