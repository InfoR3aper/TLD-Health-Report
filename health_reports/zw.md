## Delegation Scan

**Errors**:

* Superfluous name server listed at parent: ns2.gip.net A name server listed at the parent, but not at the child, was found. This is most likely an administrative error. You should update the parent to match the name servers at the child as soon as possible.

**Warnings**:

No warnings to display.

**Notices**:

* No IPv6 name servers found.

**Statuses**:

No statuses to display.

## Nameserver Scan

### `ns1.telone.co.zw`

**Errors**:

No errors to display.

**Warnings**:

No warnings to display.

**Notices**:

No notices to display.

### `ns2.telone.co.zw`

**Errors**:

* Name server ns2.telone.co.zw (194.133.122.42) does not answer queries over TCP. The name server failed to answer queries sent over TCP.  This is probably due to the name server not correctly set up or due to misconfgured filtering in a firewall. It is a rather common misconception that DNS does not need TCP unless they provide zone transfers - perhaps the name server administrator is not aware that TCP usually is a requirement.

**Warnings**:

No warnings to display.

**Notices**:

* DNS lookup error (unknown error or no error).
* DNS lookup error (unknown error or no error).

**Statuses**:

No statuses to display.

### `ns3.telone.co.zw`

**Errors**:

* Name server ns3.telone.co.zw (194.133.122.34) does not answer queries over UDP. The name server failed to answer queries sent over UDP.  This is probably due to the name server not correctly set up or due to misconfigured filtering in a firewall.
* Name server ns3.telone.co.zw (194.133.122.34) does not answer queries over TCP. The name server failed to answer queries sent over TCP.  This is probably due to the name server not correctly set up or due to misconfgured filtering in a firewall. It is a rather common misconception that DNS does not need TCP unless they provide zone transfers - perhaps the name server administrator is not aware that TCP usually is a requirement.
