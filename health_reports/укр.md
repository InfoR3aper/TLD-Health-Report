## Nameserver Scan

### `dns1.u-registry.com`

**Errors**:

* Name server dns1.u-registry.com (2607:5300:60:2e43:0:0:0:5) does not answer queries over UDP. The name server failed to answer queries sent over UDP.  This is probably due to the name server not correctly set up or due to misconfigured filtering in a firewall.
* Name server dns1.u-registry.com (2607:5300:60:2e43:0:0:0:5) does not answer queries over TCP. The name server failed to answer queries sent over TCP.  This is probably due to the name server not correctly set up or due to misconfgured filtering in a firewall. It is a rather common misconception that DNS does not need TCP unless they provide zone transfers - perhaps the name server administrator is not aware that TCP usually is a requirement.

**Warnings**:

* Could not find reverse address for 2607:5300:60:2e43:0:0:0:5 (5.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.3.4.e.2.0.6.0.0.0.0.3.5.7.0.6.2.ip6.arpa.). PTR record(s) for the address could not be found in the .arpa-zone. (ip6.arpa. for IPv6 addresses and in-addr.arpa. for IPv4).

**Errors**:

* Name server dns3.dotukr.com (2001:41d0:a:2b1f:0:0:0:1) does not answer queries over UDP. The name server failed to answer queries sent over UDP.  This is probably due to the name server not correctly set up or due to misconfigured filtering in a firewall.
* Name server dns3.dotukr.com (2001:41d0:a:2b1f:0:0:0:1) does not answer queries over TCP. The name server failed to answer queries sent over TCP.

### `nsi.uanic.net`

**Errors**:

* DNS SERVFAIL when querying 212.1.66.247 for SOA
* DNS SERVFAIL when querying 212.1.66.247 for SOA
* Name server nsi.uanic.net (212.1.66.247) not authoritative for укр.. The name server does not answer authoritatively to queries for the tested domain.  This is probably due to misconfiguration where the name server is not set up to serve the tested domain.

**Warnings**:

* Reverse for 212.1.66.247 points to an unknown host name (ic.della.ua). The PTR record for the address points to an unknown host name.
* Nameserver at 212.1.66.247 is not authoritative over UDP.

**Notices**:

* No answer received from 212.1.66.247 when querying for укр./SOA/IN.

## Consistency Scan

**Errors**:

* DNS SERVFAIL when querying 212.1.66.247 for SOA

**Warnings**:

* 2 different serials found. The SOA serial is not the same on all name servers. This is usually due to misconfiguration, but can sometimes be the result of slow zone propagation to secondary name servers.
* The listed nameservers for укр. does not all report the same set of nameservers.

**Notices**:

* No answer received from 212.1.66.247 when querying for укр./IN/NS.

**Statuses**:

No statuses to display.

## Soa Scan

**Errors**:

* Could not find reverse address for 2607:5300:60:2e43:0:0:0:5 (5.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.3.4.e.2.0.6.0.0.0.0.3.5.7.0.6.2.ip6.arpa.). PTR record(s) for the address could not be found in the .arpa-zone. (ip6.arpa. for IPv6 addresses and in-addr.arpa. for IPv4).

**Notices**:

* SOA minimum for укр. too large (345600) - recommended <= 86400. The SOA minimum is used to tell caching resolvers how long they may cache negative answers. If the value is too large, negative caching will be to aggressive.
