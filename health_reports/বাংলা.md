## Nameserver Scan

### `bayanno.btcl.net.bd`

**Errors**:

* Name server bayanno.btcl.net.bd (2407:5000:88:2:0:0:0:3) does not answer queries over UDP. The name server failed to answer queries sent over UDP.  This is probably due to the name server not correctly set up or due to misconfigured filtering in a firewall.
* Name server bayanno.btcl.net.bd (2407:5000:88:2:0:0:0:3) does not answer queries over TCP. The name server failed to answer queries sent over TCP.  This is probably due to the name server not correctly set up or due to misconfgured filtering in a firewall. It is a rather common misconception that DNS does not need TCP unless they provide zone transfers - perhaps the name server administrator is not aware that TCP usually is a requirement.

* Name server ekushey.btcl.net.bd (2407:5000:88:1:0:0:0:2) does not answer queries over TCP. The name server failed to answer queries sent over TCP.

**Warnings**:

* Reverse for 123.49.50.51 points to an unknown host name (host51.btcl.net.bd). The PTR record for the address points to an unknown host name.

**Notices**:

No notices to display.

**Statuses**:

No statuses to display.

**Errors**:

## Soa Scan

**Errors**:

No errors to display.

**Warnings**:

* Reverse for 123.49.50.51 points to an unknown host name (host51.btcl.net.bd). The PTR record for the address points to an unknown host name.

**Notices**:

* SOA refresh for বাংলা. too small (120) - recommended >= 14400. SOA refresh decides how often a secondary name server should check the primary name server for zone updates.
* SOA refresh for বাংলা. lower than retry (120 vs 3600). The retry value is the amount of time secondary name servers will wait before contacting the primary name server again if the last attempt failed.  If the refresh value is lower than the retry value, it's useless.

**Statuses**:

No statuses to display.
