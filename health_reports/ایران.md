## Delegation Scan

**Errors**:

* Superfluous name server listed at parent: ns.irnic.ir A name server listed at the parent, but not at the child, was found. This is most likely an administrative error. You should update the parent to match the name servers at the child as soon as possible.
* Too few name servers (1). Only one name server was found for the zone. You should always have at least two name servers for a zone to be able to handle transient connectivity problems.

**Warnings**:

No warnings to display.

**Notices**:

* Additional name server listed at child: b.nic.ir A name server listed at the child, but not at the parent, was found. This is most likely a configuration error, but there are sometimes reasons for setting up a zone this way.
* Additional name server listed at child: ir.cctld.authdns.ripe.net A name server listed at the child, but not at the parent, was found. This is most likely a configuration error, but there are sometimes reasons for setting up a zone this way.
