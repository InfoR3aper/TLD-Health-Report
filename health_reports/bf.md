## Delegation Scan

**Errors**:

* Superfluous name server listed at parent: ns1.ird.fr A name server listed at the parent, but not at the child, was found. This is most likely an administrative error. You should update the parent to match the name servers at the child as soon as possible.

**Warnings**:

No warnings to display.

**Notices**:

* Additional name server listed at child: censvrns0001.ird.fr A name server listed at the child, but not at the parent, was found. This is most likely a configuration error, but there are sometimes reasons for setting up a zone this way.
* Additional name server listed at child: nahouri1.onatel.bf A name server listed at the child, but not at the parent, was found. This is most likely a configuration error, but there are sometimes reasons for setting up a zone this way.
* Additional name server listed at child: nahouri2.onatel.bf A name server listed at the child, but not at the parent, was found. This is most likely a configuration error, but there are sometimes reasons for setting up a zone this way.

### `nahouri1.onatel.bf`

**Errors**:

* Name server nahouri1.onatel.bf (206.82.130.203) does not answer queries over UDP. The name server failed to answer queries sent over UDP.  This is probably due to the name server not correctly set up or due to misconfigured filtering in a firewall.
* Name server nahouri1.onatel.bf (206.82.130.203) does not answer queries over TCP. The name server failed to answer queries sent over TCP.  This is probably due to the name server not correctly set up or due to misconfgured filtering in a firewall. It is a rather common misconception that DNS does not need TCP unless they provide zone transfers - perhaps the name server administrator is not aware that TCP usually is a requirement.
